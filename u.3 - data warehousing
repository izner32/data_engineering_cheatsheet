// LESSON 1.1 - INTRO TO DATA WAREHOUSE 
data warehousing 
    - rdbms that is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing 
    - usually contains historical data derived from transactional data
operational database vs data warehouse 
    operational database 
        - oltp: online transactional processing | handles operational data, these are data contained in the operation of a particular system 
        - tables and joins are complicated since they are normalized for rdbms. This is done to reduce redundant files and to save storage space. 
        - optimized mostly for write operations 
        - datas are used to keep the business running 
    data warehouse 
        - olap: online analytical processing | handles historical data to perform analysis on these data 
        - tables and joins are accessible since they are de-normalized. This is done to minimize the response time for analytical queries.
        - optimized for read operations 
        - datas are used for analysis 
data warehouse architecture 
    sources -> 
        etl -> staging area -> 
            transformation -> data warehouse -> 
                transformation -> data marts -> 
                    transformation -> analysis

    sources 
        - usually operational database, e.g. customer database, sales database, products database 
    staging area 
        - temporary location where a record from source systems is copied 
    data warehouse 
    data marts 
        - used to divide multiple groups within the data warehouse, this is a way to organize data warehouse 
    analysis
