// LESSON 1.1 - INTRO TO DATA WAREHOUSE 
data warehousing 
    - rdbms that is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing 
    - usually contains historical data derived from transactional data
operational database vs data warehouse 
    operational database 
        - oltp: online transactional processing | handles operational data, these are data contained in the operation of a particular system 
        - tables and joins are complicated since they are normalized for rdbms. This is done to reduce redundant files and to save storage space. 
        - optimized mostly for write operations 
        - datas are used to keep the business running 
    data warehouse 
        - olap: online analytical processing | handles historical data to perform analysis on these data 
        - tables and joins are accessible since they are de-normalized. This is done to minimize the response time for analytical queries.
        - optimized for read operations 
        - datas are used for analysis 
data warehouse architecture (using three tier architecture)
    sources -> 
        etl -> staging area -> 
            etl -> data warehouse -> 
                etl -> data marts -> 
                    etl -> analysis

    sources 
        - usually operational database, e.g. customer database, sales database, products database 
    staging area 
        - temporary location where a record from source systems is copied 
    data warehouse 
        - storage for cleaned and transformed data where we could extract data for analysis easily 
    data marts 
        - divide multiple groups within the data warehouse, this is a way to organize data warehouse 
        - they don't need to access all the tables in data warehouse 
    analysis 
        - data can be accessed efficiently, e.g. olap tools, reporting tools, data mining tools, etc. 
types of data warehouses 
    host based data warehouses 
    lan based work group 
    single stage data warehouses 
    multi stage data warehouses 
    stationary data warehouses 
    distributed data warehouess 
    virtual data warehouses 
data warehouse modeling 
    - different with operational databases systems data modeling 

    data warehousing modeling workflow 
        business requirements -> conceptual data modeling -> logical data modeling -> physical data modeling -> fulfilled business requirement for data storage 

    business requirements 
        - obviously determine business requirements 
    conceptual data model 
        - contains entities(tables) and the relationships among them 
    logical data model 
        - contains attributes(columns) and constraints(especially primary and foreign keys)
    physical data model 
        - describes how the model will be presented in the database 
data warehouse design 


// LESSON 1.2 - INTRO TO OPERATIONAL DATA STORES 
definition 
    - is used for operational reporting and as a source of data for the enterprise data warehouse
operational data stores (ods) architecture 
    source -> 
        etl -> ods
            -> management reports 
            -> web based applications
            -> other applications 
            -> etl -> data warehouse  
                -> etl -> data marts 
                -> etl -> olap cubes 
operational data stores(inmon and imhoff) vs data warehouse(kimball)
    operational data store 
        - for operational reporting and supports current or near real time reporting requirements 
        - consist of only a short window of data 
        - typically detailed only 
        - used for detailed decision making and operational reporting 
        - serves as conduct for data between operational and analytics system 

    data warehouse 
        - intended for historical and trend analysis, usually reporting on a large volume of data 
        - includes the entire history of data 
        - contains summarized and detailed data 
        - used for long term decision making and management reporting 
        - serves as a repository for cleansed and consolidated data sets
