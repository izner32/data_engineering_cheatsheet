// LESSON 1.1 - INTRO TO DATA WAREHOUSE 
data warehousing 
    - rdbms that is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing 
    - usually contains historical data derived from transactional data
operational database vs data warehouse 
    operational database 
        - oltp: online transactional processing | handles operational data, these are data contained in the operation of a particular system 
        - tables and joins are complicated since they are normalized for rdbms. This is done to reduce redundant files and to save storage space. 
        - optimized mostly for write operations 
        - datas are used to keep the business running 
    data warehouse 
        - olap: online analytical processing | handles historical data to perform analysis on these data 
        - tables and joins are accessible since they are de-normalized. This is done to minimize the response time for analytical queries.
        - optimized for read operations 
        - datas are used for analysis 
data warehouse architecture (using three tier architecture)
    sources -> 
        etl with staging area(s3) -> 
            etl -> data warehouse -> 
                etl -> data marts -> 
                    etl -> analysis

    sources 
        - usually operational database, e.g. customer database, sales database, products database 
    staging area 
        - temporary location where a record from source systems is copied 
    data warehouse 
        - storage for cleaned and transformed data where we could extract data for analysis easily 
    data marts 
        - divide multiple groups within the data warehouse, this is a way to organize data warehouse 
        - they don't need to access all the tables in data warehouse 
    analysis 
        - data can be accessed efficiently, e.g. olap tools, reporting tools, data mining tools, etc. 
types of data warehouses 
    host based data warehouses 
    lan based work group 
    single stage data warehouses 
    multi stage data warehouses 
    stationary data warehouses 
    distributed data warehouess 
    virtual data warehouses 
data warehouse modeling 
    - different with operational databases systems data modeling 

    data warehousing modeling workflow 
        business requirements -> conceptual data modeling -> logical data modeling -> physical data modeling -> fulfilled business requirement for data storage 

    business requirements 
        - obviously determine business requirements 
    conceptual data model 
        - contains entities(tables) and the relationships among them 
    logical data model 
        - contains attributes(columns) and constraints(especially primary and foreign keys)
    physical data model 
        - describes how the model will be presented in the database 
data warehouse design: single data repository where a record from multiple data sources is integrated for olap | like in database design values for the data are already here, you're just going to avoid some anomalies in here 
    top down approach 
        - data at the lowest level of detail are stored in the data warehouse 
        - dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse 

        top down architecture 
            - sources(usually oltp) -> etl -> staging area -> etl -> data warehouse -> etl -> data mart  
    bottom up approach: 
        - data marts are first create to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific business processes
        - these data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse 

        UNFINISHED - bottom up architecture 

// LESSON 1.2 - INTRO TO OPERATIONAL DATA STORES 
definition 
    - is used for operational reporting and as a source of data for the enterprise data warehouse
operational data stores (ods) architecture 
    source -> 
        etl -> ods
            -> management reports 
            -> web based applications
            -> other applications 
            -> etl -> data warehouse  
                -> etl -> data marts 
                -> etl -> olap cubes 
operational data stores(inmon and imhoff) vs data warehouse(kimball)
    operational data store 
        - for operational reporting and supports current or near real time reporting requirements 
        - consist of only a short window of data 
        - typically detailed only 
        - used for detailed decision making and operational reporting 
        - serves as conduct for data between operational and analytics system 

    data warehouse 
        - intended for historical and trend analysis, usually reporting on a large volume of data 
        - includes the entire history of data 
        - contains summarized and detailed data 
        - used for long term decision making and management reporting 
        - serves as a repository for cleansed and consolidated data sets 

// LESSON 1.3 - ETL, ELT AND EL 
etl: extract, transform, load 
    - recurring method (daily,weekly,monthly) of a data warehouse system and needs to be agile, automated, and well documented

    etl workflow 
        extraction(source) -> data cleansing(staging database) -> data transformation(staging database) -> loading(target database) 
elt: extract, load, transform 

    elt workflow 
        extraction(source) -> load(target database) -> data cleansing(target database) -> data transformation(target database)

el: extract, load 
    - when you just want to move data but there is no transformation to be done 

etl vs elt 
    etl 
        - transformation are performed in etl server 
        - typically used for small amount of data 
        - used in source to target transfer 
        - compute intensive transformations 
    elt 
        - transformation are performed in the target database 
        - typically used for big amount of data 

// LESSON 1.4 - METADATA: data about data 
- roadmap to a data warehouse 
- metadata in a data warehouse defines the warehouse objects 

// LESSON 1.5 - DATA MART 
- data marts are derived from subsets of data in a data warehouse, though in the bottom-up data warehouse design methodology, the data warehouse is created from the union of organizational data marts
- fundamental use of a data mart is Business Intelligence (BI) applications
- holds only one subject area 

// LESSON 2.1 - OLAP TECHNOLOGY 
oltp: featured by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE)
    - main priority is very rapid query processing, maintaing record integrity in multi-access environments and effectiveness consistent by the number of transactions per second 
olap: database in which business users get their data from   
    UNFINISHED - types of olap 
        rolap 
        molap
        holap 
        others 
            wolap
            dolap   
            molap
            solap

// LESSON 3.1 - DIMENSIONAL MODELING 
dimensional modeling: produce database architecture that is easy for end-clietns to understand and write queries 
elements of dimensional modeling 
    fact table: event that is counted or measured 
        - numerical value 
        - e.g. a sale transaction can be converted into facts such as the number of products ordered and the price paid for the products 
    dimensional table: reference information that gives context to the facts or that describe the facts 
        - includes descriptive data about the numerical values in the fact table
        - e.g. order data, user name, product number, order ship-to, bill-to locations, etc. 
    measure: numeric attribute(column) of a fact table, representing the performance or behavior of the business relative to the dimensions  
        additive: summarize across all dimensions 
        semi-additive: summarize across some of dimensions 
        non-additive: not summarize across all dimension 
basic models used in dimensional modeling 
    - star model: one central fact table and a set of smaller tables (dimensions)
    - snowflake model: conclusion of decomposing one or more of the dimensions (after performing normalization at star model - not sure)
multidimensional data modeling: represents data in the form of cube 
    - represents data in a data cube where you could see the three dimensional tables in one model 
    - this is less computationally intensive to create (i think? idk)
    - UNFINISHED 

// LESSON 3.2 - SCHEMAS 
star schema: one central fact table and a set of smaller dimensioanl tables  
    - very simple schema 

    fact: only one fact table can contain in star schema 
    dimensional: doesn't contain another dimensional table under them unlike in snowflake 
snowflake schema: still only contains one fact table and dimensional tables that contains another sub-dimensional tables under them 
    - when dimensional tables are all normalized in star schema it becomes a snowflake schema 
star vs snowflake schema 
    star schema 
        - fact table will be at the center and is connected to the dimension tables 
        - tables are completely in a denormalized structure 
        - sql queries performance is good as there is less number of joins involved 
        - data redundancy is high and occupies more disk space 
    snowflake schema 
        - snowflake schema is an extension of star schema where the dimension tables are connected to one or more dimensions 
        - dimensional tables are normalized 
        - performacne of sql queries is a bit less when compared to star schema as more number of joins are involved 
        - data redundancy is low and occupies less disk space when compared to star schema 
fact constellation: also called as galaxy schema 
    - when two or more fact tables sharing one or more dimensional table/s
