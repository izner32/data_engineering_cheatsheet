// LESSON 1 - CLOUD CONCEPTS 
cloud computing
    - using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer 
    - in short, other's computer 
    without cloud computing 
        - someone else owns the servers, someone else hires the it people  
    with cloud computing 
        - you own the servers, you hire the it people 
six advantages and benefits of cloud computing
    - instead of paying for data center and servers, pay on demand (pay only when you consume computing resources)
    - you are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings 
    - eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs, instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need 
    - launch resources within a few clicks in minutes 
    - stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers 
    - go global in minutes (deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks)
types of cloud computing
    saas (software as a service) (e.g. gmail, office 365, salesforce) 
        - for customers 
        - don't worry about how the service is maintained. it just works and remains available 
    paas (product as a service) (e.g. heroku)
        - for developers 
        - don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or os 
    iaas (infrastructure as a service ) (e.g. aws, gcp, ms azure)
        - for admins 
        - don't worry about it stuff, data centers and hardware 
cloud computing deployment models
    cloud - fully utilized cloud computing 
        - startups, saas offerings
    hybrid - using both cloud and on-premise 
        - used by banks, fintech, investment management 
    on-premise - deploying resources on-premises using virtualization and resource management tools, also called as private cloud 
        - super sentisitive data e.g. hospital 
        - large enterprise with heavy regulation 

// LESSON 2 - AWS OVERVIEW  
global infrastructure 
    regions: physical location in the world with multiple availabiltiy zones 
        - every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply, etc. 
        - each region has at least two availability zones 
        - aws largest region is us-east 
        - not all services of aws is available in a specific region 
    availability zones(AZs): one or more discrete data centers 
        - AZs are represented by a region code, followed by a letter identifier e.g. us-east-1a
    edge locations: data centers owned by a trusted partners of aws 
        - this allows for low latency no matter where the end user is geographyically located 
    govCloud regions
        - allows customer to host sensitive controlled unclassified information and other types of regulated workloads 
        - are only operated by employees who are U.S. citizens, on U.S. soil 
        - used if you want to build something and sell it to the government or government related industries
pricing 
    aws general pricing
        - pay as you go
        - no upfront investment
        - pay less when you reserve
        - pay less by using more
        - pay per use
        - pay less when aws grows 
    three fundamental drivers of cost with aws 
        compute 
        storage 
        outbound data transfer

aws well architected framework: design principles
    scalability 
        scaling horizontally: increase in the number of resources 
        scaling vertically: increase in the specifications of an individual resource 
    disposable resources instead of fixed servers 
        instantiating compute resources: automate setting up of new resources along with their configuration and code  
        infrastructure as code: aws resources are programmable  
    automation
        serverless management and deployment: being serverless shifts your focus to automation of your code deployment 
        infrastructure management and deployment: aws automatically handles details, such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring, so you can focus on resource deployment 
        alarms and events: aws services will continously monitor your resources and initiate events when certain metrics or conditions are met   
    loose coupling 
        well defined interfaces: reduce interdependencies in a system by allowing various components to interact with each other only through specific technology agnostic interfaces such as restful apis  
        service discovery: applications that are deployed as a set of smaller services should be able to be consumed without prior knowledge of their network topology details 
        asynchronous integration: interacting components that do not need an immediate response and where an acknowledgement that a request has been registered will suffice, should integrate through an intermediate durable storage layer 
        distributed systems best practices: build applications that handle component failure in a graceful manner 
    services, not servers 
        managed services: provide building blocks that developers can consume to power their applications, such as databases, machine learnign analytics, queueing, etc. 
        serverless architectures: allow you to build both event driven and synchronous services without managing server infrastructure, which can reduce the operational complexity of running applications 
    databases 
        relational databases: provide a powerful query language, flexible indexing capabilities, strong integiry controls, and the ability to combine data from multiple tables in a fast and efficient manner 
        nosql databases: trade some of the query and transaction capabilities of relational databases for a more flexible data model that seamlessly scales horizontally 
            graph database: uses graph structures for queries  
        data warehouses: specialized type of relational database, which is optimized for analysis and reporting of large amounts of data  
    managing increasing volumes of data
        data lake: architectural approach that allows you to store  
    removing single points of failure 
        redundancy 
            standby redundancy: when a resource fails, functionality is recovered on a secondary resource with the failover process 
            active redundancy: requests are distributed to multiple redundanct compute resources 
        detect failure: use health checks and collect logs 
        durable data storage 
            synchronous replication: only acknowledges a transaction after it has been durably stored in both the primary storage and its replicas 
            asynchronous replication: decouples the primary node from its replicas at the expense of introducing replication lag 
            quorum based replication: combines synchronous and asynchronous replication by defining a minimum nubmer of nodes that must participate in a successful write opration 
        automated multi data center resilience
    optimize for cost 
        right sizing: aws offers a broad range of resource types and configurations for many use cases 
        elasticity: save money with aws by taking advantage of the platform's elasticity 
        take advantage of the variety of purchasing options: e.g. reserved instances vs spot instances 
    caching 
        application data caching: store and retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches  
        edge caching: serve content by infrastructure that is closer to viewers, which lowers latency and gives high, sustained data transfer rates necessary to deliver large popular objects to end users at scale
